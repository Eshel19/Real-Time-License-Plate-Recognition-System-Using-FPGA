## System Communication Overview

The ALPR FPGA Bridge provides a robust, modular pathway from user-space software all the way to a real-time AI accelerator implemented on the FPGA. The diagram below illustrates the layered communication stack that powers fast and reliable license plate recognition.

**Data Flow (High-Level):**
- **ALPR_SERVICE** is the main application or system daemon, responsible for managing license plate recognition requests.
- **High-Level API** (`FpgaOcrBridge`) provides a user-friendly interface for sending images and receiving OCR results.
- **Low-Level API** manages direct access to FPGA registers and memory via Linux `mmap`, handling all hardware-specific operations.
- **AXI/Avalon Bridge** exposes FPGA PIOs to the CPU as memory-mapped registers.
- **PIOs** transfer commands, status, and data bursts between CPU and FPGA.
- **Accelerator Hot Interface Manager (AHIM)** coordinates all command decoding, buffering, and result handling inside the FPGA.
- **AI OCR Core** is the hardware CNN accelerator that performs real-time character recognition.

## ðŸš€ Demo & Showcase

The FPGA_HPS_BRIDGE_AHIM system is tested and proven in real-world conditions.  
Below are live screenshots from the integrated testbench, demonstrating batch and single image processing, error handling, API protection, blank input handling, and robust recovery.

| Scenario           | Screenshot                        | What it Proves                               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Single Image       | ![single](docs/demo/single_image.png)            | Fast, correct operation on one image         |
| Batch Processing   | ![batch](docs/demo/console_batch.png)             | High-throughput, stable multi-image run      |
| Blank Images       | ![blank](docs/demo/Send_blank_batch.png)          | Robust handling of empty/no-result input     |
| API Protection     | ![api fail](docs/demo/console_fail_to_send_api.png)| API blocks invalid/bad commands, reports err |
| HW Error Detection | ![comm err](docs/demo/console_comm_error.png)     | FPGA detects protocol error, exposes state   |
| Recovery/Reset     | ![reset](docs/demo/recover_after_reset.png)       | System recovers after errorâ€”no reboot needed |

> **All images processed at hardware-accelerated speed, with round-trip latencies as low as ~2-3 ms per image. Robust error handling and reset support real-world reliability.**
