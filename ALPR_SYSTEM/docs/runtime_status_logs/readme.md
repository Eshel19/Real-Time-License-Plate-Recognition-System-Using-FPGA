# 📘 Runtime Status Logs (100-Hour System Test)

This folder contains automatically rotated status logs from a continuous 100+ hour test run of the ALPR system.

Each log file contains **two entries**, written one hour apart, summarizing the system’s state during a 2-hour window. These logs are generated by the ALPR FSM to monitor system stability and operational status.

---

## 🧪 Log Format

Each file contains exactly two lines — one per hour — captured mid-window.

### 📄 Example Filename
```
log_2025_06-11-22.log
```
➡️ Status recorded for **22:00–23:59** on **June 11, 2025**

### 📝 Example Log Content
```
2025-06-11 22:38:25 [INFO] Auto status report | FSM state: DETECTION, The system is Running for 08:59:58  
Average FPS: 16.20, Error counts: 24, Total detected LP: 4, Last LP detected: 5142616, Operation mode: folder

2025-06-11 23:38:25 [INFO] Auto status report | FSM state: SEGMENATION, The system is Running for 09:59:58  
Average FPS: 15.71, Error counts: 24, Total detected LP: 4, Last LP detected: 5142616, Operation mode: folder
```

## 🎯 Purpose

These logs are used to:

- ✅ Prove system uptime and watchdog activity  
- 📊 Monitor average FPS and error counts  
- 🔁 Track FSM state transitions and LP detection consistency  
- 📁 Document long-run resilience during stress tests
