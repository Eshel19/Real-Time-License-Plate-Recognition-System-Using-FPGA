# üö¶ ALPR_SYSTEM ‚Äì Real-Time FPGA-Accelerated License Plate Recognition

This is the main control module of the ALPR system. It coordinates input capture, object detection, FPGA OCR acceleration, logging, and fault recovery ‚Äî all through a robust finite state machine (FSM). The system is engineered for real-time, autonomous deployment on embedded Linux devices.

---

## üß† Core Responsibilities

- Capture frames from live camera or folder
- Detect license plates using NanoDet (via ncnn)
- Segment plates and send them to the FPGA for digit OCR
- Log all results and system status with auto-rotation
- Monitor and recover from camera or FPGA failures
- Respond to external commands via a thread-safe socket interface

- The FSM owns all system state and flow
- All recovery logic is embedded inside state transitions

## üì° Command Interface (via Socket)

- The ALPR system runs a **UNIX domain socket** server (`/run/alpr_system.sock`)
- It listens for commands from the CLI tool `alprcrtl`, hosted separately in the repo
- The socket thread **never directly touches the FSM** ‚Äî instead:
  - It raises internal **tag toggles** (like `requestStop`, `requestRestart`)
  - These toggles are read **safely at the beginning of the FSM loop**
  - Ensures thread-safe control without race conditions

### Supported commands:

```bash
status     # Snapshot of current FSM state, uptime, FPS, last LP
stop       # Cleanly stop the system (FSM will exit safely)
restart    # Reinit FSM without rebooting system
flushlogs  # Force logs and plates to be flushed to disk
help       # List commands
```

Example usage (from a terminal or script):

```bash
alprctl status
```

> The `alprctl` CLI is documented separately under [`alprctl/README.md`](.././alprctl/README.md).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build Setup

- Built using **Visual Studio** with **remote Linux target deployment**

### Required on the target system:
- `OpenCV` ‚Äì image input and capture
- `ncnn` ‚Äì NanoDet inference

## üõë Shutdown and Recovery

- PID file is written to `/run/alpr_system.pid`
- Auto cleanup on SIGINT, SIGTERM, or `stop` command
- FPGA is reset and logs are flushed during shutdown

*This service acts as the central runtime engine of the ALPR platform ‚Äî managing inputs, orchestrating modules, handling errors, and interfacing with both hardware and CLI tools.*
