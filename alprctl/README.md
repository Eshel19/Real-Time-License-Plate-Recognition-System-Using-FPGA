# alprctl â€“ ALPR System Control Utility

`alprctl` is a lightweight command-line utility used to communicate with the running ALPR service over a UNIX socket. It allows users to send runtime commands to the daemon in a safe and structured manner.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- âœ… Start the ALPR daemon safely with `alprctl start`
- ðŸ”Œ Send runtime commands to the daemon over a UNIX domain socket
- ðŸ§ª Validates service availability before communication
- ðŸ§¾ Simple, single-file C++ utility

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- **Start Command**:
  - Checks if the daemon is already running using the UNIX socket path (`ALPR_SOCKET_PATH`)
  - If not running, it launches the service using `systemctl start alpr_system.service`
  - Waits up to 5 seconds (50 Ã— 100ms) for the daemon to come online

- **Other Commands**:
  - Opens a socket connection to the daemon
  - Sends the command as a plain string
  - Waits for a response and prints it to `stdout`
